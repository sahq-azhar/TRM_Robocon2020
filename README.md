# TEAM ROBOCON MJCET-2020

The game will be based on Fiji's national sport rugby. In this game, each team designs two robots, one as pass robot, and another as try robot. Each can either be manual or automated. The pass robot will pick up the rugby balls, and the try robot needs to either place them to the trying spot, or to kick the ball passing through a pole, avoiding the obstacles and perform according to rule book provided.
